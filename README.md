# ISS-Locator
This is a simple Android application that fetches live International Space Station (ISS) location co-ordinates and displays the same on Google Maps.

# Functionality

1. On launching the application you will see an image of ISS on Map. This will be the most recent updated location.
2. You will also be able to view its current location on top of the screen. I am currently displaying City and Country value. If the ISS is over any Ocean; current location will be displayed as "Over a water body".
3. Click on "Refresh" button to manually update/refresh ISS's location on Map.
4. Click on ISS image on the map to start automatic refresh of location on an interval of 2 seconds. Click again on the image to stop automatic refresh.
